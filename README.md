## 🚧 The Problem: Hidden Impact

Your GitHub activity tells a story — but GitHub’s native interface makes it hard to see the full picture.

- Which languages do you truly use most?
- How have your contributions evolved over time?
- Which repositories actually create impact?
- How consistent is your development journey?

These insights exist in the data, but they’re scattered and hard to interpret.


## 💡 The Solution: Deep Analytics

GitHub Profile Analyzer transforms raw GitHub data into **meaningful developer insights**, including:

- 📊 **Contribution Trends** – activity patterns over time  
- 🧠 **Language Proficiency Analysis** – real usage, not just repo labels  
- ⭐ **Repository Performance** – stars, forks, engagement signals  
- 🆔 **Developer ID Score** – a composite score reflecting coding impact and consistency  
- 📈 **Growth Tracking** – followers, repositories, and activity evolution  

All designed to help developers understand *what their GitHub actually says about them*.
